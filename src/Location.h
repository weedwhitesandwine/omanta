// A location string is either an absolute local path ("/home/user/Pictures") or
// a URI ("trash:///", "smb://server/share"). Local files stay plain paths —
// every existing caller, test and D-Bus message keeps meaning what it meant —
// and URIs only appear once the sidebar introduces places that have no path.
//
// These functions are the one place that distinction lives. Nothing else in
// the codebase may ask "does it start with a slash".

// into a plain path — after cleaning, a local location never looks like one).
bool isUri(const QString &location);

// True when the location is on the local filesystem — the gate for things
// that genuinely need a path: terminals, thumbnails, sync stat calls.
bool isLocal(const QString &location);

// True when two locations could share a filesystem at all: both local, or
// URIs with the same scheme, host and port. Decided from the strings alone,
// so a foreign URI (one dragged in from another application, say) is never
// handed to GIO — which could mean a network round trip for an automounting
// scheme such as http — just to learn what was already certain.

// host for a mount root, the decoded last segment otherwise.
